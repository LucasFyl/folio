About: Worldwide Writers is a web platform for writers all over the world. Around 4 main cities (Berlin, Paris, London and New-York) the aim of the website is to get in touch with people sharing a passion for painting. The website lists events in your city and gives the user the ability to create an event and share it with anyone on Facebook. 
One of the goal of this project was to use Facebook and Youtube Apis.
