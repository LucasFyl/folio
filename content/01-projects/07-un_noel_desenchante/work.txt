About: « A Disenchanted Christmas » is a school project made in 2012. 
We had one week to realize an interactive advent calendar, built on flash and developed in Action Script 3. Every day of december before christmas, a new ‘gift’ was available. 
I was in charge of conceiving a graphic chart and realizing the graphic design of all the elements in three states : Before they where clicked, when they were supposed to be clicked and when they had been clicked.
