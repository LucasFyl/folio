About: Invinity started as a school project. We were asked to conceive and develop a website based on a data-visualization. We decided to communicate around the not-so-known domain of wine. Our approach was simple: We wanted to show the evolution of wine consumption and market through the years. We’ve collected datas from 1995 to 2012 then organized them via a world map. By selecting a country you ca access a brief summary of the status of wine in these countries as well as graphics with actual data that you can browse through the years. 
We presented the project to an audience of roughly 20 peoples but noticed recently that we now have around 400 page views.
