About: Labagarre.fr is a social platform for amateur or professionnal fighters. 
From boxing to kung-fu, it’s the ideal place to find an appropriate fighter to train yourself, chat with a coach, find a welcoming club or even regional tournements and gatherings! The original goal was to create a web application using flatfree, a lightweight php framework. I was in charge of some UI design, integration and all the interaction design
